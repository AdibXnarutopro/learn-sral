    "The SAR radar altimeter (SRAL) is the primary instrument that supports altimetry measurements from the Sentinel-3 satellite mission. As well as SRAL, each Sentinel-3 satellite has a microwave radiometer (MWR), and a Precise Orbital Determination (POD) instrument suite including the Global Navigation by Satellite System (GNSS), Doppler Orbitography by Radio-positioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS), and a Laser RetroReflector (LRR).\n",

    "Altimetry data is a major contributor towards the record of global sea level - an essential climate variable for the monitoring of sea level rise.\n",
